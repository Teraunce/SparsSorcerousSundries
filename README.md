# SparsSorcerousSundries
A Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous Mod

This mod was made with blood, sweat and a whole lot of crying. 

**Thank you to all the peeps on Wrath modding discord, this couldn't have been done without your patience and help.**

This mod requires this fantastic mod to function: [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).

Once a game is saved with this mod enabled it will require this mod to be present to load, so do not remove or disable the mod once enabled.
Items and enemies may depend on this mod after it is loaded into a save and could break if it was removed.

As always **Backup your saves when installing mods or removing them**

All changes are configurable and can be disabled via the unity mod manager menu.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is the latest version.
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous.
3. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases) mod from the releases page.
4. Download the [SparsSorcerousSundries](https://github.com/TheSparhawk/SparsSorcerousSundries/releases) mod from the releases page.

## Summary
The purpose of this mod is to help address the variety of magic items and spells that are available throughout your adventures in the World Wound.
The main goal is to not only add new items but also address the lack of special named versions of specific item types. As development goes on
the amount will increase. Feel free to voice any ideas you may have or item categories you feel may need some more love.
