# SparsSorcerousSundries
A Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous Mod

This mod was made with blood, sweat and a whole lot of crying. 

**Thank you to all the peeps on Wrath modding discord, this couldn't have been done without your patience and help.**

This mod requires this fantastic mod to function: [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).

Once a game is saved with this mod is enabled it will require this mod to be present to load, so do not remove or disable the mod once enabled.
Items and enemies may depend on this mod after it is loaded into a save and could break if it was removed.

As always **Backup your saves when installing mods or removing them**

All changes are configurable and can be disabled via the unity mod manager menu.
